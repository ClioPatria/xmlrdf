NEW Issues:


- ENS: agent in een conceptscheme? nee
- ENS: map persons properties to RDA Group2 elements




TODO:
- People thesaurus: use property (Bob)
- Thesaurus: put in other namespace (purl/vocabularies)?
- Thesaurus: add skos_inscheme
-----------------------------------------------------


- For the schema file, I have used the old ahm-schema.ttl file, where vra is replaced by dcterms where possible. Here we use the standard vra-dcterms mapping (http://www.vraweb.org/resources/datastandards/vracore3/categories.html#type)

- URI's are based on ahm:objectnumber as they seem unique (could also have chosen priref)

- acquisitionDate and Method both mapped to dct:provenance

- locat is mapped to dcterms:spatial, which does not really capture the essence

- ahm:reproduction is a view on the data, which might or might not be available on the web. I think it could be an hasView attached to the aggregation

- productionPlace: dct does not have a good property, so dct:descr.

- hasView: is it only for web-dereferencable material?

- What to do with all the typed bnodes?

RULES

- titleTranslation is always the en. translation of the dutch title. As such it is replaced by a dct:title @en. The original Dutch title becomes a ahm:title @nl. This is slightly weird.

- For dimensions, we have bnodes with (almost) always a value.

% For makers, we use the person thesaurus. TODO: make the object point
% to the person URI if it is in the thesaurus, or to a BNode object if
% it is not (or add it to the thesaurus). Problematic are two
% Maker properties that are context dependent, the role and the
% qualifier. there are instances where both are present. A possible
% solution is to make a subproperty for each qualifier/role combi. O

- Exhibitions could be modeled as events, using the EDM event model and stored in a (separate) thesaurus. For now, we use bnodes and 'treat them as resources'.

- related Object ->reBN'ify? : er zijn meerdere records, waarbij
meerdere relatedObjectReference en relatedObjectNotes zijn. Hiervan is
de structuur niet meer te achterhalen. in the original data there is no
XML grouping of related_object.references and related_object.notes, so
we do not reconstruct that.



NAMES/People

in people.xml:
- 66937 records
- all ahm:name s are unique.

in collection-11001-12001.xml:
- 1000 Proxies
- 988 Proxies with ahm:maker  (??)
- 988 ahm:maker bnodes with a ahm:creator value
- "onbekend"435 "onbekend (glasblazer)"	305"onbekend (glasgraveur)" 90 "onbekend (glasschilder)" 16
- 142 other
- 85 distinct
- all 988 creator fields have a unique match in people.xml

in total 6172 object literals that match one or more people record name
- 25 different properties (ref1)
- also locations etc.


Association Person:
in collection-11001-12001.xml: 195 entries, all with unique match in person thes.
- associationPerson, contentPerson, documentationAuthor, exhibitionOrganiser, reproductionCreators mapped to people name thesaurus
- contentSubject and associationSubject not mapped to people.: only few hits, clearly not people (paard, libelle..)

Alternative Number
- Again, I use the bnode reification trick, where the alternativeNumber becomes subproperty of rdfs:label of the bnode




*----------- Mapping to thesaurus.

I have looked at which literals appear as pref/altlabel values
in the converted thesaurus. There are a large number of properties
(ref2).
for now, each property gives rise to one rewrite rule.


(ref1): [reproductionCreator,creator,documentationAuthor,exhibitionOrganiser,exhibitionVenue,currentLocation,creatorDateOfDeath,AHMTextsAuthor,documentationTitle,documentationSortyear,alternativeNumberType,exhibitionCatalogueNumber,alternativeNumberInstitution,dimensionValue,creatorDateOfBirth,creditLine,productionPlace,contentMotifGeneral,acquisitionMethod,associationPerson,associationSubject,contentSubject,contentPersonName,acquisitionDate,material]

(ref2): List of metadata properties, whose object literals are the same
as preflabels of skos concepts. (starred ones are not rewritten)

[acquisitionMethod],[alternativeNumber],[alternativeNumberInstitution],[associationSubject],[contentMotifGeneral],[contentSubject],[creditLine],[currentLocation],[currentLocationFitness],[dimensionNotes],[dimensionPart],[dimensionType],[dimensionUnit],[dimensionValue*],[documentationSortyear*],[documentationTitle],[exhibitionCatalogueNumber*],[exhibitionVenue],[material],[objectCategory],[objectName],[productionDateEnd*],[productionDateStart*],[productionPeriod],[productionPlace],[reproductionFormat*],[reproductionType],[technique],[title]
